# Web-API-java-challenge


## Description
We were tasked with creating a game that displayes a question with mulitple choice answers. When that question is answered correctly it will prompt another question and so forth until you recieve a congrats message and a score. We had to use javaScript to create the functionality and even manipulated the html through it to get the game to work properly.
